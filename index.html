        <p>Hello and thank you everyone for taking a look at my future portfolio page. I am currently a Customer
          Service Represenative Clerk at Stater Bros. Markets. Due to wanting a career change and to help forge this new path
          I have decided to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. Growing up I have always been fascinated with web based
          technology (despite having limited access) and have dabbled into HTML in the past. With Angela Yu's Udemy course and
          The Odin Project, I plan on developing the skills needed to help me achieve my goal.</p>
